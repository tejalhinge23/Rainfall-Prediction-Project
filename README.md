ðŸŒ§ Rainfall Prediction Project:

Accurate rainfall forecasting plays a crucial role in agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, and urban planning. This project aims to support sustainable development, economic stability, and the well-being of communities dependent on weather conditions.
Using advanced Machine Learning models, we developed and deployed the most accurate weather prediction system to forecast whether it will rain tomorrow or not.

# Key Features:
 
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handled missing values, feature engineering, and scaling for optimal model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation: Compared multiple algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

High-Accuracy Model Deployment: Selected the best-performing model for precise predictions.

Streamlit Web App: Developed a user-friendly interface to input weather parameters and instantly get rainfall predictions.


# Approach & Workflow:

1.Data Acquisition-

Used a structured historical weather dataset containing daily observations.

Features included temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall amount.

2.Data Preprocessing-

Handled missing values with statistical imputation.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Normalized numerical features for consistent model performance.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-

Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and weather trends.

Identified the most influential factors affecting rainfall probability.

4.Model Training & Evaluation-

Tested multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors.

Applied hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

5.Model Selection-

Chose the model with the highest accuracy and balanced precision-recall performance.

Avoided overfitting by cross-validation.

6.Deployment-

Built an interactive Streamlit web application.

Users can input daily weather parameters and instantly receive predictions on whether it will rain the next day.
